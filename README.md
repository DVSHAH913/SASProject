# SAS Project

This repository showcases my Honours project from the 'Structured Query Language with SAS' course, which I pursued after completing the 'Get Started with SAS Programming' course (certificates available in my repository). The project involved addressing a real-world business problem by applying concepts learned in the course.

## Business Problem

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for airport security in the United States. I was tasked with preparing TSA Airport Claims and Enplanement data from 2013 to 2017 for analysis. The project aimed to determine the frequency of claims at each airport per year, passenger numbers, and the percentage of claims relative to passenger volume.

## Deliverables

Three essential deliverables were required:

1. `sq.Claims_Cleaned`: A clean and prepared version of the `sq.claimsraw` table.
2. `sq.ClaimsByAirport`: A table summarizing claims for each airport and year, joined with enplanement data.
3. `FinalReport.html`: A final HTML report generated by running the `AnalysisProgram.sas` on the prepared tables.

The project highlighted my skills in data preparation and analysis using SAS, showcasing my ability to solve complex real-world problems through structured querying and analysis.
